## Transforming How Companies Hire Software Engineers

At Akoka, we're on a mission to revolutionize the way companies find and hire exceptional software engineering talent. We believe that the traditional hiring process is fundamentally broken - too expensive, too risky, and too slow for today's fast-moving technology landscape.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional tech hiring forces companies to make expensive bets based on limited information. After months of searching, interviewing, and negotiating, companies often discover that their new hire isn't the right fit - leading to costly turnover, team disruption, and lost productivity.

Meanwhile, exceptional coding bootcamp graduates - motivated career changers with fresh skills and diverse perspectives - often struggle to break into the tech industry due to biases against non-traditional educational backgrounds.

## Our Innovative Solution

We bridge this gap by creating a risk-free pathway for companies to discover exceptional talent. Our carefully vetted software engineers start as contractors under our management, allowing companies to evaluate their skills, work style, and cultural fit in real-world scenarios before making any long-term commitments.

When both parties are confident it's the right match, we facilitate a seamless transition to full-time employment. If it's not working out, there's no long-term obligation - we handle everything.

## Why We Focus on Coding Bootcamp Graduates

Coding bootcamp graduates represent some of the most motivated and skilled developers in the market. They've made a deliberate decision to change careers, invested significant time and resources in intensive training, and are eager to prove themselves in their new field.

These developers bring:

- **Modern Technical Skills**: Training in the latest frameworks, tools, and industry best practices
- **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Experience tackling complex challenges under pressure
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Unique backgrounds that drive innovation and creativity
- **High Motivation**: The drive that comes from pursuing a passion and making a major life change
- **Adaptability**: Proven ability to learn quickly and adapt to new environments

## Our Rigorous Vetting Process

Not every coding bootcamp graduate makes it into our network. We have a comprehensive evaluation process that assesses:

- **Technical Proficiency**: Hands-on coding assessments and real-world problem solving
- **Communication Skills**: Ability to collaborate effectively with teams and stakeholders
- **Cultural Adaptability**: Fit with various company cultures and working styles
- **Growth Potential**: Capacity for continuous learning and professional development
- **Work Ethic**: Demonstrated commitment to quality and meeting deadlines

## Our Commitment to Success

We don't just place engineers - we invest in their success. Our team provides ongoing support, mentorship, and professional development opportunities to ensure that every placement is a win-win for both the engineer and the client company.

We measure our success not just by successful placements, but by the long-term career growth of our engineers and the sustained success of our client relationships.

## The Future of Hiring

We envision a world where hiring exceptional software engineers is as simple as trying before you buy. Where companies can access top talent without risk, and where motivated developers can demonstrate their capabilities in real-world environments.

By eliminating the traditional barriers and risks in tech hiring, we're creating opportunities for exceptional engineers to launch successful careers while helping innovative companies build world-class engineering teams.
