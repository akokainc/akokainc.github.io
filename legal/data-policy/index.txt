<h2>4. Data Subject Rights Execution</h2>
<p>The Privacy Officer must inform the data subjects of the possibility of exercising the data subject's rights under the regulation.</p>
<p>For the exercise of the rights, a request will be submitted with the data of the person interested in exercising the rights and will be sent to the email address legal@akokainc.com.</p>
<p>The information may be requested by the data subject or his or her legal representative (in cases of disability or minority), expressly by sending the request and a photocopy of the Identity Document to verify representation and detailing, where appropriate, the data to which he or she wishes to have access or on which the Privacy Officer must act.</p>
<p>In the event that the requirement of identification of the data subject is not met (e.g.: request requested by a person other than the data subject, lack of accreditation by the legal representative, etc.), the Privacy Officer informs the data subject in writing of the impossibility of attending to the request until it is identified as specified.</p>
<p>Once the request is received, the Privacy Officer decides whether or not to accept it. In both cases, it communicates the decision to the person concerned in writing so that he or she can subsequently prove it.</p>
<p>In case of dispute between data subject and the Privacy Officer, the request will be escalated to appropriate legal authorities for resolution.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the event of acceptance, the Privacy Officer may also facilitate access to your data in the corresponding file through secure digital access or direct viewing by the interested party at the Privacy Officer's premises. In this case, the Privacy Officer issues a written statement stating, with the signature of the interested party, that the right of access has been exercised in form and time. All requests for the exercise of rights received from the data subject are duly recorded.</p>
<p>In cases where the data have been collected or recorded by fraudulent, unfair or illicit means, the cancellation of the same always involves the immediate deletion, and never the blocking of the data. In any event, such deletion is carried out when possible contractual obligations are extinguished or when the law imposes on the maintenance of documents. This premise must be studied by the Privacy Officer and the sector involved before proceeding with any action.</p>
<h2>5. Reply Deadlines</h2>
<p>Privacy Officer must answer all the requests received and analysed, regardless of whether or not the personal data of the data subject appear in his or her files or processing. To this end, it uses written communication and any other means of proving that the message has been sent and received.</p>
<p>To answer the requests received, whether estimated or not, the Privacy Officer has the following maximum deadlines:</p>
<p>| Right                                     | Deadline                                      |

| Right to object automated decision making | up to 1 month from receipt of the application |</p>
<p>Once the aforementioned periods have elapsed, as appropriate, without the Privacy Officer expressly responding to the requests, these may be considered rejected and the applicant may lodge the corresponding complaint with the corresponding data protection agency and take legal action.</p>
<h2>6. Refusal of the Exercise of Data Subject Rights</h2>
<p>The Privacy Officer may deny access to files or processing when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data subject has already exercised his right within a period of less than twelve months and there is no evidence of a legitimate interest to that effect</li>
<li>The request has been made by a person other than the affected person (only in cases of disability and minority of the affected person, when it is not proven that he or she is the legal representative)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Privacy Officer can only refuse the rectification, opposition or cancellation or forgetfulness of the files or processing when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The request has been made by a person other than the affected person (only in cases of disability and minority of the affected person, when it is not proven that he or she is the legal representative)</li>
<li>The cancellation causes damage to the legitimate interests of the affected party or third parties</li>
<li>There is an obligation to retain the data under applicable employment or business laws</li>
<li>The data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims</li>
<li>The processing is necessary for the performance of ongoing placement contracts</li>

## 4. Data Subject Rights Execution

The Privacy Officer must inform the data subjects of the possibility of exercising the data subject's rights under the regulation.

For the exercise of the rights, a request will be submitted with the data of the person interested in exercising the rights and will be sent to the email address legal@akokainc.com.

The information may be requested by the data subject or his or her legal representative (in cases of disability or minority), expressly by sending the request and a photocopy of the Identity Document to verify representation and detailing, where appropriate, the data to which he or she wishes to have access or on which the Privacy Officer must act.

In the event that the requirement of identification of the data subject is not met (e.g.: request requested by a person other than the data subject, lack of accreditation by the legal representative, etc.), the Privacy Officer informs the data subject in writing of the impossibility of attending to the request until it is identified as specified.

Once the request is received, the Privacy Officer decides whether or not to accept it. In both cases, it communicates the decision to the person concerned in writing so that he or she can subsequently prove it.

In case of dispute between data subject and the Privacy Officer, the request will be escalated to appropriate legal authorities for resolution.

Likewise, in the event of acceptance, the Privacy Officer may also facilitate access to your data in the corresponding file through secure digital access or direct viewing by the interested party at the Privacy Officer's premises. In this case, the Privacy Officer issues a written statement stating, with the signature of the interested party, that the right of access has been exercised in form and time. All requests for the exercise of rights received from the data subject are duly recorded.

In cases where the data have been collected or recorded by fraudulent, unfair or illicit means, the cancellation of the same always involves the immediate deletion, and never the blocking of the data. In any event, such deletion is carried out when possible contractual obligations are extinguished or when the law imposes on the maintenance of documents. This premise must be studied by the Privacy Officer and the sector involved before proceeding with any action.

## 5. Reply Deadlines

Privacy Officer must answer all the requests received and analysed, regardless of whether or not the personal data of the data subject appear in his or her files or processing. To this end, it uses written communication and any other means of proving that the message has been sent and received.
